# Changelog for MagikSetup Class

## Version 1.0.0 - [2023-10-24]

### Added

    Introduced the MagikSetup class to manage and centralize logging setups based on external 
    JSON configuration files.
    
    Implemented the ability to use a default configuration file, while also offering the flexibility 
    to specify custom configuration paths.
    
    Integrated the `MagikLogger` class to initialize and configure logging based on the provided or 
    default configurations.
    
    Incorporated comprehensive error handling for various scenarios, including:
        - Missing configuration file
        - JSON parsing errors
        - Missing keys in the configuration
        - File reading permissions
        - UTF-8 encoding issues
        - Other system-related errors during configuration loading
    
    Offered a set of default logging settings which can be used in the absence of specific configurations 
    in the JSON file, ensuring continuous logging capabilities.
    
    Designed a method to initialize the logger configurations, detailing the current setup, and providing 
    useful information about the logger's state.
    
    Integrated an informative logging sequence during the logger's initialization, offering insights about 
    the logger's configuration.

### Future Extensions

    Enhance the configuration validation, ensuring not just the presence but also the correctness of the 
    values in the configuration file.
    
    Introduce a backup configuration mechanism, allowing the system to fall back to a previous configuration 
    if there are issues with the current one.
    
    Optimize the initialization process, possibly by encapsulating configuration loading and logger setup 
    into a single method for ease of use.
    
    Expand the capabilities of the MagikSetup class, incorporating more advanced features and customization 
    options for logging setups.
