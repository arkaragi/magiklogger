# Changelog for MagikLogger Class

## Version 1.0.0 - [2023-10-24]

### Added

    Released the MagikLogger class, offering a versatile and high-performance Python logging toolkit. 
    This toolkit is designed for exceptional debugging experiences and general application logging.
    
    Introduced capabilities for logging messages to both console and file systems, allowing users to specify 
    their preferences during logger instantiation.
    
    Integrated support for different logging levels, allowing users to specify upon object initialization and 
    dynamically change the log level post-creation.
    
    Incorporated a rotating file handler mechanism to ensure log files don't grow indefinitely. 
    This auto-rotation triggers when log files reach a specified size, preserving older logs in backup files.
    
    Presented a comprehensive API, including utility methods like:
        - _log_message: For logging messages at specified levels with robust exception handling.
        - _set_log_format: For changing the log message format across all handlers.
        - _set_log_level: To dynamically adjust the logger's log level.
        - _enable_logging: A versatile method to enable or disable logging for specific handler types.
        - _handler_exists, _add_handler, _remove_handler: Methods to manage logger handlers seamlessly.
    
    Offered public methods (debug, info, warning, error, critical) to log messages at respective log levels, 
    providing an intuitive interface for users.
    
    Integrated the ability to dynamically change log format and level post-logger creation using set_log_format 
    and set_log_level methods.
    
    Incorporated methods to enable or disable specific logging channels (console or file) dynamically, 
    enhancing flexibility.
    
    Ensured a high level of robustness and validation, making sure that the logger operates effectively 
    without causing disruptions to the parent application.
    
    Delivered thorough documentation with comprehensive docstrings for each method and the class, 
    ensuring a clear understanding for developers.
    
    Added a comprehensive test suite for the magik_logger.py module.

### Future Extensions

    - Advanced Handler Configurations: 
        Investigate potential integrations with external logging services or databases.

    - Concurrency Handling: 
        Develop mechanisms to seamlessly manage multi-threading and multi-processing scenarios in logging.

    - Enhanced Customization: 
        Enrich the logger with advanced formatting options, meta-information logging, and other customizability features.

    - Performance Optimization: 
        Continuously assess and refine the logger's efficiency, ensuring optimal performance even under high logging loads.

    - Timestamp Customization: 
        Allow users to specify their preferred timestamp format for log entries.

    - Tagged Logging: 
        Implement a feature for logging messages accompanied by specific user-defined tags.

    - JSON Logging: 
        Facilitate logging of dictionaries directly as JSON-formatted strings.

    - Contextual Logging: 
        Design a method that enables logging messages with supplementary contextual information.

    - Custom Filtering: 
        Grant users the ability to add their own filters to the logger, refining the log output based on specific criteria.
